# ESP8266 for Arduino UNO

This repository contains my ESP8266 working with a Arduino UNO.

See the sub folders in this repository for test scripts.

## The wifi.ino script

1. Connects to a WIFI AP, and gets IP address. Configure the vars for your needs.
2. When button on INPUT PIN 2 is pressed, a HTTP request is sent to google.
